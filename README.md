# Creating a Highly Available, Secure, and Resilient Website with an AWS-Registered Domain Name That Can Scale to Demand in a Round-Robin Fashion
---
________________________________________
## 1. Overview
This project demonstrates how I created a VPC that I used for servers in a production environment. To improve resiliency, I deployed the servers in two Availability Zones using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. For additional security, I deployed the servers in private subnets. Requests are routed through Amazon Route 53, which resolves the domain name to the Load Balancer. The Load Balancer then distributes the incoming traffic to the backend servers. The servers can connect to the internet by using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, I deployed the NAT gateway in both Availability Zones.
### Key Features:
-	**Scalability**: Managed via Auto Scaling Groups.
-	**High Availability**: Servers deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
-	**Security**: Isolated private subnets with controlled access via a Bastion Host.
-	**Routing and Load Balancing**: Implemented using Amazon Route 53 and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
-	**Resiliency**: Dual NAT Gateways for redundancy.

## 2. Architecture Diagram
The following diagram provides an overview of the resources included in this project. The VPC has public subnets and private subnets in two Availability Zones. Each public subnet contains a NAT gateway and a load balancer node. The servers run in the private subnets, are launched and terminated by using an Auto Scaling group, and receive traffic from the load balancer. The servers can connect to the internet by using the NAT gateway.

## 3. Key Components
### 3.1 VPC Configuration
#### **Subnets**:
-	Private Subnets: Dedicated to backend servers. 
-	Public Subnets: Contain Load Balancer and NAT Gateways.
#### **Routing**:
-	NAT Gateways: Enable internet access for resources in private subnets.
 ### 3.2 Application Load Balancer (ALB)
-	Routes traffic to servers in private subnets.
-	Configured with target groups and health checks for optimal performance.
### 3.3 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
-	Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.
-	Spans multiple Availability Zones for redundancy.
### 3.4 Amazon Route 53
-	Provides DNS services for domain name registration and resolution.
-	Routes requests to the ALB using alias records.
### 3.5 Security Measures
-	**Security Groups**: Define rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
-	**Bastion Host**: Ensures secure SSH access to private subnet resources.

## 4. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions
### 4.1 Prerequisites
-	An AWS account with required permissions.
-	A registered domain name.
-	Basic knowledge of AWS networking and Linux commands.
### 4.2 Implementation Steps
#### **Step 1: Configure the VPC**
-	Navigate to the VPC console.
-	Create a VPC with public and private subnets.
-	Configure Route Tables and attach NAT Gateways for internet access.
 

#### **Step 2: Setup the Auto Scaling Group**
-	Create a Launch Template specifying instance type, AMI, and key pair.
 
-	Define the Auto Scaling Group, associating it with private subnets.
 

#### **Step 3: Create a Bastion Host**
-	Launch an EC2 instance in a public subnet.
-	Configure the security group to allow inbound SSH on port 22.
 

#### **Step 4: Deploy Backend Servers**
-	SSH into the Bastion Host.
 
-	Securely transfer private keys to the host using SCP.
-	SSH into backend instances via the Bastion Host.
 

#### **Step 5: Configure Web Servers**
-	Create an HTML file and host it using Python's built-in HTTP server.
-	For persistent hosting, install and configure Apache: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt update  
  sudo apt install -y apache2  
  sudo systemctl enable apache2  
  sudo systemctl start apache2  
  ```

 

#### **Step 6: Setup the Load Balancer**
-	Create a target group pointing to backend servers.
-	Attach the target group to an ALB configured within the VPC.
 

#### **Step 7: Configure Route 53**
-	Register or purchase a domain name.
-	Point the domain's DNS records to the ALB using alias records.
 

#### **Step 8: Secure the Website**
-	Request an SSL/TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager.
-	Attach the certificate to the Load Balancer.
